## Introduction
This repository is a resource for anyone looking to enhance their C programming skills. Whether you're a beginner learning the basics or a more experienced programmer looking to practice advanced concepts, this collection of C programs will provide challenges across various levels.

## Features
- **Basic Programs:** Learn the fundamentals such as data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Intermediate Programs:** Practice recursion, arrays, pointers, strings, and file handling.
- **Advanced Programs:** Explore more complex topics like memory management, data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues), and algorithm implementation.
- **Problem-Solving:** Programs focusing on problem-solving skills using C.
- **Debugging Practice:** Programs that require you to identify and fix bugs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the C programs in this repository, you will need:
- A C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any other IDE supporting C (Code::Blocks, Dev C++, etc.).

### Installation
